**🔐 [STM32 Encrypted Comms](https://github.com/kaifanzheng/stm32-encrypted-comms)**  
Secure messaging between microcontrollers with RSA encryption, UART, and a custom-built keypad + OLED interface.

**⚡ [CUDA Image Clustering](https://github.com/kaifanzheng/cuda-image-clustering)**  
GPU-accelerated segmentation pipeline using PCA + K-Means — 85% faster and just as accurate. Zoom.
